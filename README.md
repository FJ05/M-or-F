# M-or-F
A project that uses machine learning to identify a male or a female.
***Keep in mind when using the application that the machine learning algorythm was only trained on 12,5MB of data.***
The training data was pictures of studens at my school and stock-images. This leads to the application not correcly recognizing "older" looking people
